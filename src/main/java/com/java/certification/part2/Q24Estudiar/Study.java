    /*exports and exports…to. An exports module directive specifies one of the module’s packages whose public types (and their nested public and protected types) should be accessible to code in all other modules. An exports…to directive enables you to specify in a comma-separated list precisely which module’s or modules’ code can access the exported package—this is known as a qualified export.

requires. A requires module directive specifies that this module depends on another module—this relationship is called a module dependency. Each module must explicitly state its dependencies. When module A requires module B, module A is said to read module B and module B is read by module A.

uses. A uses module directive specifies a service used by this module—making the module a service consumer. A service is an object of a class that implements the interface or extends the abstract class specified in the uses directive.
